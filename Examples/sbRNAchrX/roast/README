This is the README file for the SMORE roast run.

This is a small example set including nematode tRNAs on chromosome X.

This folder contains two subfolders, input and output. The output was created by calling SMORE roast on the input files.
The programm call is the following:
SMORE roast requires the output of SMORE prep and SMORE mix as input!

SMORE roast --out output --in input/allClusters_joined.txt --species input/specieslist --newick input/tree8species.newick
(This command is also written in the file commandlist in SMORE mix output.)

The output folder contains several files. The files are listed in the following in several categories. The text in brackets gives a short description for each file. For more detailed information, we refer to the manual on www.github.de/AnneHoffmann/Smore

The following output files are counts for the specific cluster list that was used as input. In case, several clusterlists are used, there will be a corresponding set of output files for each of them.
Summary.txt (Summary of the run with running time and basic information about the input data.)
errors_allClusters_joined.txt (List of errors that might have occured. If empty, no error occured.)

The following output files are counts for the specific cluster list that was used as input. In case, several clusterlists are used, there will be a corresponding set of output files for each of them. The files are ALL needed for SMORE eat.
