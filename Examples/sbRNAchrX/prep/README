This is the README file for the SMORE prep run.

This is a small example set including nematode tRNAs on chromosome X.

This folder contains two subfolders, input and output. The output was created by calling SMORE prep on the input files.
The programm call is the following:

SMORE prep --out output --maf input/data_cel --genes input/sbRNAs_chrX.bed --ref ce11

The output folder contains several files. The files are listed in the following in several categories. The text in brackets gives a short description for each file. For more detailed information, we refer to the manual on www.github.de/AnneHoffmann/Smore

The output contains the following main output files:
Summary.txt (Summary of the run with running time and basic information about the input data.)
errors_smoreprep.txt (List of errors that might have occured. If empty, no error occured.)

The output contains the following subfolders:
genes (Files that are needed to create the clusters. Needed for later subcommands such as SMORE toast or SMORE mix.)
temp (Files that are needed to check for missing anchors. Needed for later subcommands such as SMORE toast or SMORE mix.)
bed (Files that are needed to create the clusters. Needed for later subcommands such as SMORE toast or SMORE mix.)
