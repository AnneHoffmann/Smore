Information on graph structures and corrections:
Number of cographs 8, with on average
0.25 nodes, 0.00 edges and a density of 0.00.
Number of non-cographs 0, with on average
0 nodes, 0 edges and a density of 0.
All non-cographs were corrected to obtain a cograph structure.


Finished toast mode at Wed Oct 25 16:23:12 2017 
Output files of SMORE bake can be found here: /homes/biertank/bsarah/Documents/projects/trnaevo/TestFastRun/sbRNAchrX 
The final tree can be visualized using the online tool iTOL. Files to be uploaded on the iTOL page are located in /homes/biertank/bsarah/Documents/projects/trnaevo/TestFastRun/sbRNAchrX/data_iTOL
For more information on SMORE bake output, use 'SMORE --helpout' or check the manual.
