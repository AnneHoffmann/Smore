This is the README file for the SMORE mix run.

This is a small example set including nematode tRNAs on chromosome X.

This folder contains two subfolders, input and output. The output was created by calling SMORE mix on the input files.
The programm call is the following:
SMORE mix requires the output of SMORE prep as input!

SMORE mix --out output --prep input --species input/specieslist --newick input/tree8species.newick

The output folder contains several files. The files are listed in the following in several categories. The text in brackets gives a short description for each file. For more detailed information, we refer to the manual on www.github.de/AnneHoffmann/Smore


The output folder contains the following files (some of them will be needed for further runs of SMORE subcommand such as SMORE roast.):
Summary.txt (Summary of the run with running time and basic information about the input data.)
errors_smoremix.txt (List of errors that might have occured. If empty, no error occured.)
allClusters_joined.txt (List of original clusters, hence the cluster number together with all its elements. Needed for SMORE roast. This might include several cluster list, depending on the number of clusters.)
allClusters_original.txt (List of joined clusters, hence the cluster number together with all its elements.)
commandlist.txt (List of commands to be run when starting SMORE roast on the data. This might include several commands in case the number of clusters is too high.)
allTypes.txt (List of types of functional genes that were included during the analysis.)
allPseudoTypes.txt (List of types of pseudogenes that were included during the analysis.)
nones.txt (Counts for functional genes without anchors.)
pseunones.txt (Counts for pseudogenes without anchors.)
specieslist (List of species, needed for SMORE roast.)
