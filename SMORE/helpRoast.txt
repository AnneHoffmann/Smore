This subcommand starts from a list of genetic clusters and will output
lists of genetic events that can be further proceeded as an input
for SMORE eat. SMORE roast can be used for large data sets in order
to split and parallelize the process. The next subcommand in the
pipeline will be SMORE eat.

Usage: 
smore roast --out PATH --in FILE --newick FILE (--id FILE)
            (--seqsim NUM) (--strucsim NUM) (--nomiss) 
            (--verbose)
            (--graph)
            (--aln)
            (--tool PATH) (--python PATH) (--perl PATH)

Legend:
() optional parameter
[] set of parameters that belong together
| either the first or the second option 


    --out|-o PATH       folder where to write the output files. If the folder
	                does not exist, it will be created
    --in|-i FILE        output file of smore mix containing a list of
                        clusters
    --species FILE      file listing all species one per line. Species
                        identifier must be the same as in newick or id
			and prep output data.
    --newick FILE       tree in newick format containing the species included
	                in the output of smore prep.
    --id FILE		in case the species' identifier do not fit, this file
	 		can be used to automatically translate the names
			Format (tab separated):
			current_name_in_tree name_to_translate_to
    --seqsim|-s NUM     percentage of sequence similarity to be considered
	                homolog sequences, default 0.8
    --strucsim|-p NUM   percentage of structure similarity to be considered
	                homolog sequences, default 0.8
    --nomiss            do not check for missing anchors. in case of large
                        clusters, using --nomiss will speed up the runtime
    --verbose           print all intermediary files, thus clusters
    --graph             print only intermediary graph files
    --aln             print only intermediary duplication alignment files

    #optional parameter for all subcommands
    --tool|-t PATH      path to where the smore tool is located. Only needed,
                        if the tool is located in a very specific location
    --python PATH       path to python, onlz needed if python3 is not installed
                        within the environment path variable
    --perl PATH         path to perl, only needed if perl is not installed
                        within the environment path variable
