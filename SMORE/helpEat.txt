This subcommand is used after SMORE roast and will take list(s) of
evolutionary events and output a phylogenetic tree with event and
element counts. SMORE eat is able to summarize the outputs of
parallelized runs such that all data is recombined at the
phylogenetic tree.

Usage: 
SMORE eat --out PATH --prep PATH
      	  --mix PATH --roast PATH
      	  --newick FILE (--id FILE)
          (--nomiss) 
          (--tool PATH) (--python PATH) (--perl PATH)

Legend:
() optional parameter
[] set of parameters that belong together
| either the first or the second option 


    --out|-o PATH       folder where to write the output files. If the folder
	                does not exist, it will be created
    --prep PATH         output folder containing SMORE prep output
    --mix PATH          output folder containing SMORE mix output
    --roast PATH        output folder containing SMORE roast output
    --newick FILE       tree in newick format containing the species included
	                in the output of SMORE prep.
    --id FILE		in case the species' identifier do not fit, this file
	 		can be used to automatically translate the names
			Format (tab separated):
			current_name_in_tree name_to_translate_to
    --nomiss            do not check for missing anchors. in case of large
                        clusters, using --nomiss will speed up the runtime

    #optional parameter for all subcommands
    --tool|-t PATH      path to where the SMORE tool is located. Only needed,
                        if the tool is located in a very specific location
    --python PATH       path to python, onlz needed if python3 is not installed
                        within the environment path variable
    --perl PATH         path to perl, only needed if perl is not installed
                        within the environment path variable
