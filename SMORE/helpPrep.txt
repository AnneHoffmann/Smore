This subcommand will sort genetic elements in between genomic anchors
based on MultiZ alignments. The genetic elements are
taken from a list given as input or retrieved based on a covariance
model as input for infernal.


Usage: 
smore prep --out PATH --ref REFSPECIES --maf PATH 
           (--filter NUM) 
           (--tool PATH) (--python PATH) (--perl PATH)

with one of the following possibilities (a-d):

a)       [--cm FILE --genomes PATH (--infernal PATH) 
          (--incE NUM |--incT NUM) (--pseudo NUM)]
b)       [--genes FILE ]
c)       [--genomes PATH --loci FILE ]
d)       [--trna (--trnascan PATH) --genomes PATH]


Legend:
() optional parameter
[] set of parameters that belong together
| either the first or the second option 


  #General options
    --out|-o PATH      folder where to write the output files. If the folder
                       does not exist, it will be created
    --ref|-r ID        name of the reference species as given in MultiZ files
    --maf|-m PATH      folder containing all MultiZ alignments. Files can be
                       compressed.
    --filter NUM       optional: remove a percentage of the lowest scoring
	               blocks base on the MAF scores; between 0 and 100
  #Modes
    ##CM mode
    --cm|-c  FILE      covariance model file, input for infernal
    --genomes|-g PATH  folder with genomes of the species used as an input
                       to infernal to scan the genomes for genetic elements
		       specified by the CM. Filenames should match species
		       names in MultiZ files.
    --incE NUM         optional parameter for infernal, e-value threshold
    --incT NUM         optional parameter for infernal, bitscore threshold
    --infernal PATH    optional, path to infernal installation if not installed
                       in the path environment
    --pseudo NUM       optional, bitscore threshold that defines pseudogenes

    ##Genelist mode
    --genes FILE       a list of genetic elements as input.
	       	       Format (tab separated):
			
	               chromosome start_pos end_pos species strand type
		       pseudogene sequence structure comment
			
		       -fields to be omitted are filled with NA
		       -species name should be the same as in MultiZ files
		       -type is optional (e.g. tRNA type Met)
		       -pseudogene (optional): true or false
		       -structure is optional, dot-bracket-notation
		       -for optional sequence, take loci mode
		       -comment is optional

    ##Loci mode
    --genomes|-g PATH  folder with genomes of the species used to retrieve
		       the sequence of the genetic elements in the loci list
		       based on their coordinates. Filenames should match
		       species names in loci list files.
    --loci FILE        list with genetic elements without sequence
		       Format (tab separated):
			
		       chromosome start_pos end_pos species strand type
		       pseudogene
			
		       -fields to be omitted are filled with NA
		       -species name should be the same as in MultiZ files
		       -type is optional (e.g. tRNA type Met)
		       -pseudogene (optional): true or false

    ##tRNAscan-SE mode
    --trna             switch on mode that applies tRNAscan-SE on given genomes.
    --genomes|-g PATH  folder with genomes of the species used to retrieve
		       the sequence of the genetic elements in the loci list
		       based on their coordinates. Filenames should match
		       species names in loci list files.
    --trnascan PATH    optional, installation path of tRNAscan-SE if not in 
                       environment variable

  #optional parameter for all subcommands
    --tool|-t PATH      path to where the smore tool is located. Only needed,
                        if the tool is located in a very specific location
    --python PATH       path to python, onlz needed if python3 is not installed
                        within the environment path variable
    --perl PATH         path to perl, only needed if perl is not installed
                        within the environment path variable
